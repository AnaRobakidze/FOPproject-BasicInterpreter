# Simple BASIC Interpreter

## Project Description
This project involves designing and implementing a simple interpreter for a minimal subset of the BASIC programming language. The interpreter supports basic constructs such as variable assignments, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, iterative control flow, and basic output operations. It is designed to execute simple algorithms as a proof of its functionality.

## Language Choice
The interpreter is built for a subset of the BASIC programming language, chosen for its simplicity and alignment with the project's objectives.

## Algorithms for Test Cases
1. Sum of First N Numbers
2. Factorial of N
3. GCD of Two Numbers
4. Reverse a Number
5. Check if a Number is Prime
6. Check if a Number is Palindrome
7. Find the Largest Digit in a Number
8. Sum of Digits
9. Multiplication Table
10. Nth Fibonacci Number

## Project Objectives
- Define a minimal subset of BASIC.
- Implement a simple interpreter to process and execute BASIC code.
- Test the interpreter with predefined algorithms to ensure correctness.
